      <p className="text-foreground">
        At Skykey, we believe true luxury is feeling at home wherever you are. We were born in Madrid with a clear idea: to offer spaces where comfort, design, and authenticity come together to create unique stays.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        Every apartment we open is more than a place to sleep — it’s an invitation to live the city with freedom and space, and with that sense of well‑being only a home can provide. That’s why we say Skykey is the key to the sky — the door to a perfectly balanced urban experience between the city’s rhythm and the comfort of your personal refuge.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        Our team combines a passion for hospitality with meticulous attention to detail. From location to decor, we care for every aspect so guests feel part of the place without giving up their own living space.
      </p>
      <p className="text-muted-foreground">
        Today, we continue growing beyond Madrid with the same vision: to make every city feel like your home.
